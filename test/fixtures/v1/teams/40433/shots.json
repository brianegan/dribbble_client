    "description": "<p>We get asked a lot of questions by people wanting to learn from us. W're not sure why, but some of you seem to think we actually know what we are doing. That’s flattering but honestly we’re just making this up as we go.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, when we get asked these questions, over email, on dribbble, twitter, instagram, faxes, courier pigeons, etc, we usually try and give some sort of answer but it’s honestly hard to answer everyone. To really think about the advice and communicate it in a clear way takes time — sometimes a lot of time.</p>\n\n<p>So we came up with the idea of Dear Ueno, an advice column where people can send in questions and we try and answer them to the best of our ability.</p>\n\n<p>The questions can be about anything you want but typically we can probably give better answers on things like development, design, photography, copywriting, branding, marketing etc. But now and then we might also be able to give you some relationship advice if we are in a good mood.</p>\n\n<p>So, how does this work?</p>\n\n<p>1. You submit a question. You can do this either by emailing us at <a href=\"mailto:hi@ueno.co\" rel=\"noreferrer\">hi@ueno.co</a> with the subject line “Dear Ueno” or by asking us on Twitter with the hashtag #DearUeno . Include your name (fake if you want), location and profession.</p>\n\n<p>2. Every other week we will pick one question and someone on our team will answer it for you. The answer will get featured in our newsletter as well as on our social channels. Don’t forget to subscribe to our newsletter to get all the advice straight to your inbox: <a href=\"http://www.ueno.co/newsletter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">www.ueno.co/newsletter</a></p>\n\n<p>That’s it! Simple, right?</p>\n\n<p>Ok, bye.</p>",
