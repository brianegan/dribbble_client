And here are two cases to clarify below:</p>\n\n<p>1) On the road when you are heading close to the gas station user gets a notification-invitation to fill gas to your car.\n<br />2) When stopping at the gas station, we provide the info regarding the targeted promo event. For example, «5% discount on coffee for Smart Shell cards owners» thus increasing the sales conversion.</p>\n\n<p>⚡️ Don’t miss to review the attached file for more details.</p>\n\n<p>- - - - - - - - - - \n<br />Follow us to keep in touch: \n<br /><a href=\"https://www.behance.net/Chapps\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Behance</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chapps.team/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chapps_team\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Twitter</a></p>",
